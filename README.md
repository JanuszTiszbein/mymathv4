# mymathv4

-      :  calculates number pi
-      :  changes degrees to radians
-      :  calculates the absolute magnitude based on (double distance from earth in parsecs , double apperiant magnitude )
-      :  based on absolute magnitude and Spectral class calculates bolometric magnitude (double magnitude , char spectral)
-      :  calculates absolute luminosity from bolometric magnitude
-      :  checks if life is possible on the star form (double absolute luminosity, double radius of the orbit(in AU)) y=yes if there is water in liquid state , n=if its not possible
